This lab report details how to install VScode and remotely connect through ssh using a unique individual email.

## Installing VScode
I already had VScode installed from a previous course. I opened a new window and included a screenshot to show that VScode is downloaded.

For future reference, in order to download VScode, go to the Visual Studio Code website and download onto Windows system. 

## Remotely Connecting

### Find individual account
I found my individual account on [this website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). I put my username (used for ucsd), and student ID, which returned a unique account `cs15lwi23xxx` where xxx is 3 unique letters.
