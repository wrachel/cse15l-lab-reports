# Lab Report 4

In this lab report, I will be explaining how I completed steps 4-9 in the lab with the fastest time I could achieve. 

### Step 4: Log into ieng6
Keys pressed: ```<enter>```

I had the command `ssh cs15lwi23aup@ieng6.ucsd.edu` already typed into the terminal, since the timer only starts once enter is pressed. 
When I pressed enter I did not have to type in my password since previously, I copied the public ssh key from my local computer to the remote account. This makes it faster, since everytimg I log in I no longer have to type a password everytime I use ssh to access the remote computer. 

### Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
Keys pressed: git clone ```<Ctrl-C><left click on terminal><Ctrl-V><enter>```

I had used ```<Ctrl-C>``` to copy `git@github.com:wrachel/lab7.git`. I got this from my forked repository (depicted below).

I have previously generated SSH keys for Github. The below image shows how the SSH key has been added to my github. This allows me to clone and commit to a repository from the remote computer.

### Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
Keys pressed: ```<Ctrl-C><left click on terminal><Ctrl-V><enter>``` ```<Ctrl-C><left click on terminal><Ctrl-V><enter>```

### Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test

### Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

### Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
